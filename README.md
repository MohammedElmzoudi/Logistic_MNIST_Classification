# Logistic_MNIST_Classification
From "scratch" logistic regression handwritten digit classifier trained on MNIST
# Description
- A Logistic Regression Classification model created using only numpy and other basic libraries trained on 60,000 26x26 MNIST images.
This project includes a binary classifier and a multiclass classifier using an implementation of the "One vs. All" logistic regression technique.
